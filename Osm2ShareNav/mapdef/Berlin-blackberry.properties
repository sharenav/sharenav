#	 If there is no internal version in Osm2ShareNav for the png / sound files, you must provide external versions
#	 in the current directory or sub-directories 'sound' and 'png' inside Osm2ShareNav.jar (when using internal style-file)
#	 or sub-directories 'sound' and 'png' in the same directory as the external style-file.

# Sound formats to be included in the midlet, default is useSounds=amr.
#  Osm2ShareNav includes from all sound files wav, amr and mp3 variants.
#  Wav is the most compatible, loudest but also the most size intensive format.
#  Example to include wav AND amr: useSounds=wav, amr
#  ShareNav will try a fallback to another included sound format when trying to play a format unsupported by the device.

# Directory/Directories with sound files and syntax.cfg, default is useSoundFilesWithSyntax=sound
#  syntax.cfg is a text file defining which sound files
#  are played by ShareNav for the various routing instructions in which order (to respect grammar)
#  Osm2ShareNav includes all sound files referenced in the syntax.cfg either from an internal folder
#  or the directory with the specified name relative to the style-file.
#  File Format examples are at:

#   German: http://gpsmid.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gpsmid/Osm2ShareNav/resources/media/sound-de/syntax.cfg?view=markup.
#  Currently the following sound-files with syntax are internal to Osm2ShareNav:
#   English: sound  German: sound-de Finnish: sound-fi
#  Example to include the Finnish and German sound files: useSoundFilesWithSyntax=sound-de, sound-fi

**** REWORK/REMOVE Predefined Waypoints
**** add icon menu improvements 


GpsMid 0.8
    *** Map Performance ***
    - Zooming far out, panning around and zooming somewhere else in is now much faster.
      This is achieved by dropping requests for loading tiles that are off-screen
      or do not need to be rendered because zoomed to far out
    - Reorganized style-file for better performance when zoomed out
    - The map screen now updated more often during panning when dragging the touch screen.
      (not only after the ImageCollector class has finished drawing the map but every 1/3 s) (thx walter9)
    - Bug fix: The ImageCollector thread no more is started twice
      when a saved destination is restored at GpsMid startup (thx walter9)
    - small & smallish areas (like lakes) are no more rendered when zooming very far out
    - The number of not loaded tiles are displayed in the left upper corner,
      and a * sign after the number if the map is actually being rendered (thx walter9)
    *** Routing Performance ***
    - Fixes and improvements for mainstreet net. In motorcar transport mode
      this speeds up route calculation and reduces memory requirements for far distances.
    - Lower values for distance to mainstreet net speed up route calculation.
      It's now possible to put 1 into Setup/Routing as distance in km to Mainstreet Net,
      GpsMid will handle it if there's no Mainstreet Net within this distance
      at the route start or destination.
    - Default value for distance to mainstreet net in new midlets is now 2 km instead of 3. 
    - adjustment to routing parameters for faster route calculation - routes
      should be as good as before, please report if you get worse routes than
      earlier
    *** Map Display ***
    - Optional travel mode display (& setting on touch screen phones) on map
    - Fixed an error that prevented to load all route / map tiles of the Germany map from thju
    - The width of the line to the destination is now configurable in Display Options,
      default value is 2. (thx pos_ei_don for drawWideLine())
    - Additional backlight level 10% for Nokia and Android mobiles, so now there is 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
    - Some workarounds (mainly useful for sea rendering) for map data overflows which can
      appear due to shortcomings of Osm2GpsMid
    - Map switch can now be done without restarting GpsMid
    - Accuracy of fix can be shown with GPS status and with a circle around GPS position
    - Number of satellites is show in some more cases also in NoFix situations.
    - New option in map features to draw ways not usable by the current travel mode darker
    - On new GpsMid installations on devices with a display height or width > 400
      the base zoom level is now 24 instead of 23 (map is zoomed once in).
    - New setting for altitude correction.
    - Option to use the GPS clock as clock source for on-map display
      (currently only NMEA-transmitting GPS devices give clock information)
    - Option to set a time difference in minutes between device time and display time
      (to work around platforms which for some reason give incorrect time
      e.g. due to deficiencies in JVM time zone code)
   	*** Style-file ***
    - new attribute 'allowedForRoutableWays' in style-file.xml for configuring if a tile scale level is allowed
      to contain routable ways (default is "true"). If a tile scale level does not contain
      any routable ways, it e.g. does not have to be searched for route line creation which results in better performance.
    - small and smallish areas are stored based on their diameter in more appropriate tile levels
      (new parameter "attractAreasWithSmallerBoundsDiameterThan" in style-file) 
    - support toll rules separately for each travel mode in routemodes.inc.
      Ways will still be rendered with toll decoration only if toll=yes or toll=true is set
      regardless of toll rules or current travel mode
    - experimental support for dashed areas
      add e.g. <lineStyle dashed = "true" /> for landuse/industrial in style-file)
    - added way types for tourism/zoo and for other tourism areas    
    *** Touchscreen ***
    - On the map screen long tap * to toggle track recording
    - During track recording long tap recorded trackpoints on the map screen to suspend/resume track recording
    - On the map screen long tap _ to manage track list, double tap _ to manage waypoints
    - On the map screen long tap on the compass direction to turn map North up and invalidate course for routing
    - Double tapping the wayname bar for searching removed because single tapping _ should be used for this
    *** User Interface ***
    - Received position SMS can now be pasted to DegLat in "Enter waypoint" dialog
    - Favorites can be optionally shown as routing targets in route icon menu. 
      Favorites which don't fit in the first icon menu screen can be gotten to by
      vertical scroll (drag or cursor down) of the icon menu.
    - Clickable markers for POIs: URLs and phone numbers on map are now optionally touchable links which open the URL in a web browser,
      and with a long tap (or with a single tap if there's no URL) open a context menu
      (Here&Online). On keyboard-only phones, the same is achieved by either clicking
      the "fire button" or positioning the cursor marker inside a marker area and choosing Here&Online.
      The default style doesn't have any POIs defined as clickable, but map objects
      which have URL and/or POI information will be clickable, if map is built
      with url&phone support enabled. See the wiki documentation
      on how to modify the style file to add clickability to POI types and how to modify
      map creation .properties to enable url & phone storing in map.
    - Long tap on map now opens a context menu which now has nearby POI search in addition to the
      previously-existing online functions; also has options to route to and set as destination.
      Long tap on a clickable marker POI allows for opening POI url, phone or editing POI tags.
      On keyboard-only phones, the content menu is accessible as the Here&Online menu (formerly
      names as Online).
    - Optional split-screen mode, where map is in upper half of screen and icon menu is in lower half of screen.
      Useful for e.g. one-touch waypoint recording, routing etc. when the device screen size allows for it.
      Keyboard commands are current not handled for split-screen mode, so it's practically useful currently only
      for touch screen device users.
    - Time to change backlight level with keys 1 and 3 or zoom buttons on touch screens
      after toggling backlight has been increased to 5 seconds.
    - More icon sizes are included, you can now choose from "useIcons = small|true|big|large|huge" in the .properties file.
      useIcons=large and useIcons=huge make sense for devices with high resolution displays
    - Increased defaults for maximum search results in new midlets
    - If backlight method is known for the phone model backlight is turned on by default in new midlets.
    - In Waypoints dialog multiple waypoints can be chosen and selected "Display as outline"
      to just display an outline of the selected waypoints. This is helpful to temporarily render area
      outlines defined by waypoints. (This feature requires waypoints to be entered / imported
      in a sensible order for ouitline rendering)
    - New option in Setup / Here&Online to disable internet access during runtime
    - Help tab added to icon menu
    - Links to online help for touchscreen and GpsMid wiki in Online menu
    - Display & touch screen helper in help menu
    *** Routing Usability ****
    - Optional big navigation icons for next two instructions including their distance in upper left corner
    - When turn restriction checking is on, take account also the driving direction
      in route calculation - in other words, when driving with car, don't assume we
      can start driving backwards without a u-turn or can just take a u-turn with no costs
    - The name of the motorway exit is shown in the route instruction
      if a "motorway junction" node exists at the motorway exit  
    - The route line is now rendered on top of POIs as well when the cursor is close to it
      because in regions with many POIs e.g. trees mapped next to the streets
      the route line became hardly visible
    - Optionally aim for shortest time or shortest distance
    - Optionally stop routing when we arrive at destination
    - On new GpsMid installations on devices with a display height or width > 400
      the minimum route line width is now 5 instead of 3.
    - Don't pause GpsMid (& close location producer) if we're routing 
    - Fixed bug causing no route line at the end of the route and wrong instruction
      (reason: wrong closeby routeNode could be determined on the destination way)
    - More consistent color for u-turn big navigation icons
    - Footways are now non-accessible for bicycles if the way has no tag like bicycle=yes as well
    - Options to show or not show the big arrows or the small in-map arrows.
    - New option in Setup/Debug to show route calculation traces in map,
      connections requested from mainstreet net are drawn wider
    - area crossing lines are drawn wider
    - double tap or two-finger tap on distance field will trigger a route recalculation
    - long tap on distance now always asks for route (re)calc options
    *** Search ***
    - The POI search distance is now configurable; default is 10 km. A high limit
      does not work in all areas, depending on number of map objects (tile size?).
    - bug fix to prevent POI search crashes which appeared more often on slow
      devices and less often on faster devices
    - heed max search count for POI search, bugfix for name search fencepost error
    - new menu entry to save result as a favorite
    - fulltext search now easily accessible on touch screen phones;
      the "*" key function moved to the cursor keyboard
    - eliminate delay in showing results
    - filter results (or most of them at least) when using qwerty keyboard
    - sort by distance is now the default for favorites
    - the state of sort by distance or sort by name is remembered separately for
      favorite search & map data search
    - fixed bug with sort by distance
    - If word search is set and map (since map version 72) doesn't have word indexes, fall back
      to full name search
    *** Osm2GpsMid / Osm2GpsMid GUI ***
    - Route destinations for the route corridor are saved in last.properties. After loading
      a .properties file with route destinations you can press "Calculate Route Corridor"
      to (re-)generate the route corridor.
    - new tile size/count preset "even fewer and large map tiles" to generate maps for powerful mobiles
      while keeping the number of files in map data not very high. This might be useful for most
      Android devices but also to be able to install e.g. on Nokia 5800 very big jars (~200 MB)
    - new default for tile size/count in generated maps is now "average tile file size and count"
    - no more messages about invalid turn restriction if ways of the relation are tagged with access=no
    *** Sea generation ***
    - greatly faster sea generation algorithm with option useSeaTiles = true
      in .properties file. It divides the map into roughly 20km * 20km areas
      which are processed one at a time, total time taken is a small fraction
      of the time taken without useSeaTiles and map data is smaller.
      There are however more map artifacts when using the option and shortcomings
      which lead to incorrect choices of land / sea are triggered more often
      when seatiles are used.
    *** Predefined waypoints ***
    - An option for predefined waypoints (entered via the icon menu) is now available.
      Currently the predefined waypoints are fixed in the program, in the future they
      will be user-settable. When a predefined waypoint icon is pressed, the named
      waypoint (possibly with extra info asked from user) will be saved as a waypoint
      and in the track if track is recording. Predefined waypoints which don't fit
      on one icon menu screen can be gotten to by vertical scroll (drag or cursor down)
       of the icon menu.
    *** Digital compass ***
    - Support for JSR179 Orientation class compass (e.g. Nokia C6-01)
    - Auto-switch between compass & movement now works even when previous setting was movement
    - Add option for rapid rotation (without this, rotation by compass happens whenever
      a GPS location is received)
    - Adjust compass deviation on portrait/landscape switch
    *** Tacho ***
    - HDOP is shown in tachometer
    - Tacho is shown as a kind of "computer-mode screen" at the same time with map when in split-screen mode
    *** Alerts ***
    - Generic alerts can now be defined in style file for visual & audible alerts
      on selected POI types. An alert is triggered whenever a POI with alert
      is drawn on the canvas (which is a bit bigger than the screen, meaning
      alerts will happen before POI is visible). Alerts for POI types are defined in
      style file, by adding
		<alert alert="true"/>
      after hideable flag (currently the last place in a POI entry). Alerts
      are switchable on & off in setup / sounds & alerts.
    *** Phone models ***
    - make photos work on Samsung Xcover B271 (and probably some other Samsungs too)
    - new .properties entry "addToManifest" to add a line to manifest.mf and .jad,
      e.g. MIDlet-Touch-Support:true to hide keyboard on Samsung Bada mobiles
      or  LGE-MIDlet-Display-Nav-Keypad:no on LG mobiles
    - new J2ME build target: Gpsmid-Generic-midsize with location API
      & bluetooth & file access support, but complicated search & multimedia turned off
      to keep memory footprint smaller
    - J2ME build target Gpsmid-Generic-editing renamed to GpsMid-Generic-full-connected
      to better describe what the target does. Backwards compatibility exists so even
      .properties files with GpsMid-Generic-editing will work.
    - made full-connected be the default target (was full)
    *** Android Support ***
    - Android version is now part of the release, and the Android .apks are inside Osm2GpsMid
      for building bundled maps for Android
    - support for building bundled maps for Android now exists, see details about signing
      at end
    - a bundled .apk can now also be chosen as a map
    - New map format with outline areas for Android exists, using this requires
      if you compile GpsMid's source code yourself a small modification to J2MEPolish,
      see the wiki page mentioned at the end
      or README.txt in source
    - many stability / usability improvements including a bunch of bug fixes
    - targets now correspond to the J2ME build targets
    - multitouch two-finger rotate & pinch zoom 
    - a bunch of bug fixes & UI improvements
    - photo support
    - update apk permissions to match what GpsMid requires
    - in routing choice added buttons for selection of route mode - no need to go through menu
    - huge icon menu images are used by default which makes the icons look much better
    - new option for backlight setting: Android WindowManager (KEEP_SCREEN_ON), with dimming
    - new Android native location provider which can be used instead of JSR179
    - reduced the number of build targets to simplify builds & distribution; different
      targets (2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc.) can be uncommented in build.xml if needed
    - some minor adjustments due to upgrading to J2MEPolish 2.3, related to file dialogue
    - various UI improvements and fixes with back key handling
    - audio recording now works (n.b.: the location is currently always /sdcard directory)
    - first incomplete try at taking photos - the preview doesn't work yet, so user has to aim blind,
      and apparently the default preferences for picture quality are always not so good.
    - For easier support of sounds for routing by default WAV and AMR files
      are stored uncompressed in the map data as required for Android
      (.properties parameter default dontCompress = wav,amr)
    - back key now by default required twice for exiting GpsMid, the old
      behaviour of exiting with one press of back key is optional
    - switching double tap off now works on Android, in other words eliminates the
      delay for single tap on map. Double tap on map is now off by default on
      Android for faster response on hightlighting map control buttons.
    - double tap is better recognized now
    - on multi-touch devices, two-finger tap works the same as double tap
    - showing GPS accuracy is now on by default
    - Osm2GpsMid can now create unsigned and (depending on platform) signed .apk's
      - an .apk is produced if target name contains "android".
      - about signing: to be able to install this .apk into an
        Android device, you probably must sign it with jarsigner,
        to which there are multiple possibilities (the first two work only
        if your Java environment has a working jarsigner program available)
        * add signApk = true to .properties
        * command line, e.g.
          "jarsigner -digestalg SHA1 -sigalg MD5withRSA finland-0.7.76-map71.apk gpsmid"
        * use zipsigner, an android app to sign an apk in the device,
          see http://code.google.com/p/zip-signer/
      - apks can be signed by Osm2GpsMid only if the platform has a correct jarsigner installed
        so it can can be accessed with a simple jarsigner call
      - it seems a GNU/Linux systems with java developer environment
        offers jarsigner so it works, on an OS belonging to the Microsoft Windows family
        jarsigner is not in the java runtime environment, but is included in the JDK.
        If signing with this jarsigner works is not successfully tested yet.
        
        No reports from other platforms yet.
    - for more info and instructions, see also
      https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gpsmid/index.php?title=Android which is also
      available from GpsMid's help menu
    *** Developer Map bundling tool ***
    - syntax changed for tools/bundlemap.sh

GpsMid 0.7.7
    *** Map display ***
    - optionally simplify whan drawing when busy drawing the map (due to panning or
      not being able to keep up with map updates)
    - new heuristic for displaying correct orientation when stopping e.g. at traffic lights
    - fault tolerance for GPX track handling: if the RecordStore for tracks is damaged,
      an alert is now shown but the track list is shown anyway so the user can hopefully
      recover most of the tracks
    - show lakes at outer zooms and at the same layer as woods
    - added Finnish NLS topographic map to web connections
    *** User interface changes ***
    - on phones with a back hardkey, it is now possible again to leave
      menus with this key (cancelling any changes).
      This stopped working when back behaviour for Android was implemented.
    - search: fix cursor right behaviour: it adds the next character of the name of the object
      under cursor
    - search: cursor right past end of string now shows list of housenumbers for selected way segment
    - a virtual cursor keypad for easy selection of search results for touch screen users
    - show number of satellites also with NoFix on devices which support it
    - Show bluetooth options in GPS setup only when a BT receiver is chosen
    - add some CSS for making things nicer-looking on Android phones (and others using the J2MEPolish GUI)
    *** Platforms ***
    - Android: due to UI improvements with the help of CSS, using the menus is now a bit more bearable
    *** Tacho ***
    - now PDOP is actually shown in tachometer on JSR179 phones
    - fixed odometer bug where it would add extra distance to a trip at start
    *** Osm2GpsMid ***
    - allow user to select map accuracy in .properties file with mapPrecisionInMeters=X
      (default 1 meter) - mainly for debugging & test purposes
    - support for oneway=-1
    *** Sea support ***
    - Sea generation with generateSea=true in .properties is partially supported,
      known to work:
      * when the map area is small enough and consists of islands&islets with closed outlines
         consisting of natural=coastline in the sea, no coastlines crossing map
      * when the map area consists of land with no coastlines
      * most cases work when coastline of an island or continent crosses the map border
      Known to fail (in most cases with sea flooding over land, sometimes swapping sea & land)
      * when OSM map is cut by administrative border so neighbouring countries are not
        in map data and thus coastlines don't extend to map borders (e.g. Spain, Greece)
      * when coastline has other interruptions
      * when coastline of an island or continent crosses the map border - some cases, especially when
        the coastline way crosses the map boundary more than two times
      * when map area is sea with no coastlines (Osm2GpsMid interprets it as land)
      * this appears less often now:
        when map area is too big (no messages at generation, but failures at map loading in GpsMid)
        - triangle artifacts in the map

GpsMid 0.7.6
    *** Routing ***
    - routing bug fixes, e.g. related to fixing incorrect penalties for bogus turns
    - a route start at a toll road / motorway is now allowed even if option to use those is not set
    - a warning is shown after route line completion if the route had unavoidable motorways / toll roads
    - an info is shown after route line completion if the route contains toll roads
    - info about possible poor route result in calculation speed setting label
    - optionally warn (warning on by default) of poor routes if calculation speed is not 0
    - bug fixes to route line and remove wrong check direction warnings in some roundabout situations
    - a route is no more calculated against a roundabout's direction when walking. This makes instructions clearer.
    - non-integer (decimal) speeds are now allowed for travel modes
    - fixes for showing non-metric units, thanks brait
    - support for distances in English units (yards) in navigation instructions (changes also in syntax.cfg
      for this)
    *** Searching ***
    - optionally warn (warning on by default) of incomplete search results when search limit is reached
    - fixes for more than 126 POI/way styles: search works now, maybe other fixes too
    *** Maps display ***
    - configurable text & background colors for altitude display
    *** OSM POI & Way editing ***
    - support for editing and deleting OSM POIs; available in OSM edit menu which will show nearby POIs
      and also for ways and POIs via name or POI search (select Edit OSM data from the search result menu)
    - OSM POI editing is only available with "Generic/editing" and requires internet access on the mobile
    - minor UI changes
    *** Osm2GpsMid ***
    - show size of OSM XML data read, thanks walter9
    - some housenumber relation handling bug fixes
    - fix crash at handling of some small maps doesn't crash
    - allow start with java -jar Osm2GpsMid.jar propertyfile.properties for easy batch
      processing (map source specified in .properties)
    *** Platforms ***
    - workaround for Android OSM POI editing
    - bugfix for Nokia S60 utf-8 latin handling in OSM edit
    - log debug output in utf8, thanks brait
    - add cellid suport for LG devices
    - allow cellid database to contain entries which can be used with
      phones which can't access LAC (some Nokia models, LG phones),
      option cellIDnoLAC=true in .properties
    *** CellID logging ***
    - fix cell ID logging, was broken since January
    *** Build scripts & building ***
    - add some scripts (for GNU/Linux etc.) to build GpsMid with a minimal map
    - release and nightly now built with J2MEPolish 2.2.1 (earlier was with 2.1.4)

GpsMid 0.7.5
    *** ERRATA for style file with more than 126 POI elements ***
    - Errata for "allow for more than 126 POI/way styles, up to 253 for default midlets"
      * ERRATA: nearby POI search is unavailable in 0.7.5 if there are more than 126 POI elements.
        Fixed in git May 20, 2011 - expect this to be fixed in 0.7.6.

    *** Bug fixes **
    - fix nearest POI search bug

GpsMid 0.7.4 (internal version, not released)
    *** House number search **
    - House number search (street name & house number) can be enabled
      by setting useHouseNumbers=true in .properties or checking the checkbox in the Osm2GpsMid GUI
    - to search, use the '#' key to end the street name or house number, e.g. Picadilly#10#
    - in multi-word search (explained below), also ' ' works to end the street name or house number
    - Currently Osm2GpsMid can connect house numbers to streets encoded in the map as
      * associatedStreet relations (no support for interpolation yet)
      * addr:street tagging
      * nearest way: when addr:street is not in map data, connection is made with heuristic,
        i.e. matching to the nearest named way
    - support mainly for addr:housenumber and addr:street tagging, not for the Czech
      scheme with is_in tags, though the code might partially work with a modified style file
    - like multi-word search, house number search can require a bunch of memory.
    - enabled only for "Generic/editing", "Generic/full" (and "Generic/microemulator") targets.
    *** Search user interface ***
    - POIs and areas are now indexed with is_in (nearbys)
    - the star key (*) switching between nearbys has a new last step where also the last
      nearby is hidden so that the distance and compass direction are shown
    - horizontal scroll (optionally) of the search result under cursor or all search results
    - option to use a large font for better UI on hi-res devices
    *** Multi-word search ***
    - New feature multi-word search, available currently in "Generic/editing", "Generic/full" (and "Generic/microemulator")
      as it can require more memory than single word or whole name search. Can be added to others with "bigsearch"
      pseudo-api keyword in custom-devices.xml; requires recompiling.
      To add multi-word indexes to map, set useWordSearch=true in .properties.
    *** Osm2GpsMid ***
    - More memory usage optimizations for Osm2GpsMid reducing memory usage during map creation
      by up to 35%, thx walter9
    *** Routing ***
    - the route line is now rendered only up to the closest point to the destination on the destination way,
      so when using a POI or house number as destination GpsMid will route more exactly there
    - if auto zoom is activated the map will be zoomed in further
      when getting closer than 200 m route distance to the route destination 
    *** Appearance ***
    - bigger icon; 15x15 -> 48x48
    *** Style File ***
    - allow for more than 126 POI/way styles, up to 253 for default midlets
      (more than 254 are possible with separate "bigstyles" pseudo-api not currently enabled for any target)
      * ERRATA: nearby POI search is unavailable in 0.7.5 if there are more than 126 POI elements.
        Fixed in git May 20, 2011 - expect this to be fixed in 0.7.6.
    - add regular expression matching for specialisation tag in style file.
      Example:
		<specialisation key = "ref" regexp="true" value = "^154..*$"/>
    - add style-file-configurable way relation expansion with "asRelation"
      e.g. for bus routes:
			<Wvalue name = "bus" priority = "19">
				<description desc = "Bus line" />
				<asRelation relation = "true"/>
				<namekey tag = "name" />
				<namefallback tag = "ref" />

      or add combined="true" to combine same type relations into one:

				<asRelation relation = "true" combined="true"/>
    *** Platforms ***
    - On WinCE sound works now with a fallback NoiseMaker code when playerUpdate doesn't get called
    - work around a Samsung Wave route line disappearance platform bug (thx walter9)
    - some tweaks to make Android version UI better handle the Android keys
    *** Map format change 65 -> 66 ***
    - GpsMid midlet can read map format 65 and map format 66 for some backwards compatibility
    - indexes now have a long for housenumber & multi-word matching
    - old format s*.d index phased out in favor of new format n*.d for name index, new indexes
      h*.d for housenumbers and w*.d for words.
    - can now have more than 126 styles. If there are more than 253 styles, a word will be
      used for storing the style, otherwise a byte will be used; the byte is now treated
      as unsigned. A bigstyles pseudo-api needs to be added to custom-devices.xml to
      build a midlet with support for more than 253 styles, it's currently not enabled for any target.
    *** Misc. bug fixes ***
    - GpsMid: fixed empty/invalid map startup infinite loop bug (tracker 3288429)
    - Osm2GpMid: fixed handling of multipolygons where a way is in more than one multipolygon
    - When zooming out the off distance now stays correct, so no route recalculation is
	  triggered. This is done by calculating the distance between the
	  actual gps coordinates and the nearest way position when there's a valid GPS position
	  and the screen is centered to the GPS position (thx walter9)
	 
GpsMid 0.7.3
    *** Map Elements ***
    - added natural=waterfall
    - process associatedStreet relations and store them in house number index when
      useHouseNumbers is true in .properties. House number search has not been added
      yet so house number searches are not yet available, but will be added to GpsMid later.
    - names for islands and islet are now printed even when the island or islet has no place=island
      tag but has a name
    *** Searching ***
    - add word search option. Can be switched on in GpsMid display settings.
      To be used, requires useWordSearch to be set to true in .properties so the necessary
      word search index will be built. Matches for any word in a name, only single words for now,
      multi-word match will be added later.
    *** Map Screen ***
    - return to 3/4 -speed slow map rotation as GpsMid was supposed to
      do before 2010-11-30 from 1/4 rotation.
    *** Optimizations ***
    - speed optimizations to triangulation (Osm2GpsMid), tnx jiri.klement
    - memory use optimizations (Osm2GpsMid), tnx jiri.klement and walter9
    *** Misc. bug fixes ***
    - correctly report Osm2GpsMid run duration
    - fix night mode colors for virtual keyboard
    - fix bug with GpsMid failed startups on Symbian S60r3
    *** i18n-related bug fixes ***
    - fix bug preventing external maps from workin when language set to pl
    - work around umlaut problems with Splash author names

GpsMid 0.7.2
    *** Map Screen ***
    - filter out heuristically invalid courses for map rotation
    - fixed frequent freezes when rendering toll roads in eagle view 
    *** Touchscreen support ***
    - reduce time for triggering a long tap from 1500 to 1000 ms
    - long tapping ">" now sets the destination
    - long tapping the distance will (re)calculate the route with the current settings
    *** Map Elements ***
    - added POIs for amenity=embassy and shop=chemist
    - optimized png files with pngcrush to reduce midlet size
    *** Platforms ***
    - handle 'Back' commands on Android so that settings are saved with back button like is the Android custom
    - resuming the application from pause will no more make the splash screen show, e.g. on Android and Bada
      (corrected how GpsMid handles Midlet.startApp())
    *** Translations ***
    - some translations have been updated
    - start of i18n for Osm2GpsMid (including way & POI types & other strings visible in GpsMid)
    - Finnish translation for Osm2Gpsmid (Translations_fi*)
    *** Others ***
    - Wait for route base tile to be loaded instead of throwing "Routing thread crashed unexpectedly" exception
      when trying to calculate a route shortly after the midlet startup when the route base tile is not loaded yet
    - workaround for NoSuchMethodError when using Osm2GpsMid with Java 1.5. If for your platform 
      currently Java 1.6+ can't be used. The workaround does however
      not support UTF-8 encodings in syntax.cfg for route instructions and in .properties

GpsMid 0.7.1
    *** Important bug fix ***
    - GpsMid now starts even when phone is set to a language unsupported by GpsMid, phone has default language
      support and language is set to device default
    *** Building the map ***
    - support for osm.pbf files (actually already with 0.7)
    - cellid params can be specified in .properties and stored in .properties
    - support for UTF-8 .properties
    - bug fix: disable build buttons after map was built
    *** Others ***
    - minor updates: cs translation, Samsung S8000 backlight

GpsMid 0.7
    *** ERRATA (bugs with workarounds, found after the release) ***
    - If GpsMid crashes at startup, and your phone's language is one not supported by the GpsMid version:

      Set your phone's language to English. Now you can start GpsMid, set the language in GpsMid
      to be English (Setup / Display). After that you can switch your phone's language back to the original.

    *** Map Screen ***
    - Greatly improved area rendering:
      J2ME mobiles can only draw triangles, so for rendering, filled polygons need 
      to be split into triangles.
      This is now done by Osm2GpsMid resulting in faster rendering in GpsMid.
    - Large Areas are split into smaller areas resulting in faster area rendering as well.
    - Multipolygon support (OSM inner / outer relations)
    - Additional map views:
      - Eagle: GpsMid's great 3D View (experimental)
      - Moving Enhanced: rotated view enhanced to see more ahead
    - No. of sats and recorded points now have a background box.
    - A base zoom level can be entered in setup, that will be used as base for auto zoom.
    *** Icon Menu and Touchscreen support ***
    - Optional virtual number/text keypad in search screen
    - Icon Menu will switch to 4x3 in landscape mode if the device informs us about its rotation 
    - Sliding horizontally at least a quarter of the screen width switches icon menu pages
    - Slide to the right on the Status Bar in the map screen to lock / unlock touch screen devices
    - Icons / Tabs and Touch Controls in the map screen get highlighted when touching them  
    - Gestures in Search results:
      - Double tap an entry: route to entry / use as destination
      - Slide horizontally at least one char height to the right: route to entry
      - Slide horizontally at least one char height to the left: select entry
      - Slide horizontally half screen width to the left: show search text field
      - Slide horizontally half screen width to the right: toggle sort mode
      - Touch the right 20% of the screen: same as * key - toggle favorites/waypoints or collapse street names
      - Slide vertically: scroll result list
    - Single Tapping, double tapping and long pressing on touch controls in the 
      Map Screen with many new different functionalities
    - Complete Overview of Touchscreen support is at 
      http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gpsmid/index.php?title=Touchscreen_Layout
    *** Localization for voice and route instructions ***
    - You can now specify a text file called syntax.cfg in the sound directory.
      For examples of syntax.cfg extract from the Osm2GpsMid.jar with an unzip utility
      the directories sound and sound-de which both contain a syntax.cfg.
      Osm2GpsMid will include all sound files referenced in syntax.cfg
      into the generated midlet. (Sound file names are the sound files referenced
      in syntax.cfg in lower case with the extensions specified with useSounds, e.g. amr)
      For specifying the sound directory/directories containing the syntax.cfg
      use e.g. : useSoundFilesWithSyntax=sound, sound-de, sound-fi.
      The sound files of the specified directories are bundled into GpsMid
      and the directories are choosable in Setup/Sounds & Alerts.
      GpsMid will prefer files from the specified sound directory/directories in the file system
      or fall back to the files in the specified sound directory integrated into Osm2GpsMid.
    - Only German voice and route instructions:
      Specify in your .properties file: useSoundFilesWithSyntax=sound-de
      This will include the German sound files into GpsMid        	     	   
    - Only Finnish voice and route instructions:
      Specify in your .properties file: useSoundFilesWithSyntax=sound-fi
      This will include the Finnish sound files into GpsMid (thx jkpj)
    - English and German eSpeak voices now sound a bit more friendly   	     	   
    *** Localization of on-screen messages ***
    - Translaton of many on-screen messages into Czech, Slovak, Finnish, German
      and Russian, to a smaller degree to French, Italian and Portugese.
      When building with the Osm2GpsMid GUI (wizard), the languages will have
      en estimate of how complete the translations are. The rough scale is:
      5: Complete or almost complete
      4: Normal user-visible messages complete or almost complete
         (many or even most error messages may be untranslated)
      3: Many user-visible messages untranslated
      2: A relatively big portion of user-visible messages translated
      1: Some menus and messages translated
      Please make the translations more complete in the GpsMid Wiki!

    *** Map Elements ***
    - Improved color for buildings
    - Added area types shop=*, leisure=pitch, landuse=farm_yard, landuse=military
	- Added POIs for shop=bicycle/organic/clothes, guest house, ticket machine and more
    - Changed colors for landuse=commercial and graveyards/cemeteries
    - Paths with bicycle=designated / foot=designated added and drawn like footways / cycleways
    - Highways with toll flag get now drawn with a special decoration
    *** Routing ***   
    - If GUI is optimized for routing, after selecting in the Search results "Route"
      or "As destination", do not move map to destination, thus the route gets calculated
      from the current map position to the selected search result.
    - Allow Toll Roads / Motorways. With these new options you can specify if GpsMid will 
      route using toll roads / motorways. This also reduces the maximum number of 
      travel modes per midlet from 5 to 4.
    - Allow to specify in Setup/Routing the seconds the examined route path gets delayed
      at traffic signals during calculation. The value is used only during calculation.
      It is NOT used for ETA calculation, which is hardcoded to 20 seconds (if traffic 
      signals are far enough apart). Also in contrary to ETA calculation, the delay is 
      only applied if not to consecutive connections start at a traffic signal route node.
      Don't set this too high as it will slow down route calculation because GpsMid will 
      examine more route paths trying to avoid the connections delayed by traffic signals 
      and this therefore would also sometimes result in strange routes.
    - Improvements on when a bearing instruction has to be given and when not.
    - The route line is above other ways now when the cursor is close to it
      rather than only when the map position is synchronized to GPS.
    *** GPS and other location producers ***
    - Show NoFix with JSR-179 if no fix is available (thx djinnn)
    - Show number of satellites with JSR-179 if device supports it (thx djinnn)
    - Fixed a problem with the NMEA sentences generated by HTC Touch Diamond 2 with JavaFX JVM
    - Digital compass support, works currently on Android and on Nokia S60 
      (compass-equipped) phones with CellID helper
    - Keypress support for CellID location
    *** URL and Phone number support ***
    - GpsMid can now open websites and call phone numbers associated with POIs and Ways in search results
      and on the map (ways only on the map for now). W signifies Website and P signifies Phone.
      To configure for use, add useUrlTags=true and usePhoneTags=true to .properties file
    *** New platform: Android support (experimental) ***
    - Android support is experimental and not release-quality or an official part of the release,
      thus no official 0.7 Android release binaries. Experimental .apk's are available
      in the nightly directory http://gpsmid.sourceforge.net/nightlies/
    - Android support is "first version" - most stuff works, but there's much which isn't
      polished, there are some crashes, and the UI is not at all Android-like so it won't feel
      nice. There are plans for improvement.
    - External zip file or directory maps are the simple & recommended way to use GpsMid on Android
    - Bundling can be used with scripts in tools, but not as easily as for J2ME and not easily
      on all operating systems.
    - Voice recording & taking pictures don't work yet
    *** Usability ***
    - Way point list can be sorted by time, distance or alphabetically.
    - Menu to quickly enter predefined way point texts. These are hardcoded but in the
      future it is planned to read them from a file.
    - Search results are now refreshed with a new strategy until all null strings are resolved to names
    - Ways can now have icons which show up in search and map overview screens
    - Tracks (including the one being recorded) can now be displayed and renamed when a track is being
      recorded. You have to pause the recording however before you can get to the track menu.
    - The entries in the File-/Directory Requester Dialog are now sorted (folder first, alplabetically)
      and contain only files with the suffix(es) that can be chosen. Please note e.g. on Nokia
      mobiles files with suffix ".jar" are not shown, you have to change the suffix to ".zip" for external maps.
    - Waypoints are now stored in the track by default when recording a track

    *** Others ***
    - The Setup option "backlight only in map screen" has been recycled to 
      "backlight only as keep-alive" which only triggers the backlight every 60 s to 
      ensure continuous screen updates etc. on some phones while saving battery 
      compared to keeping the backlight on all the time.
    - In Osm2GpsMidGUI there's a new option to select from tile size presets, e.g. for newer Nokia mobiles
	  it's recommended to use big tile sizes as the number of files in the jar seem to be limited
	  while on mobiles with small RAM small tile sizes usually will work better.        
    - Compass directions now have the correct names according to 
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction now (thx billi25)
    - Russian cyrillic letters work now in Search screen (thx dimmer123)
    - Fix a recordstore error that caused settings to be not consistent on some mobiles (thx jkpj)
    - Fix NullPointerException when accessing tracks on corrupt record stores 
      preventing to access readable tracks (thx Petr Dlouh�)
    - Winter speed limits actually trigger an alert now (thx jkpj)
    - GUI search screen colors can now be chosen with style-file.xml (colors.inc)
    - better support for non-metric units and optionally km/m instead of just m in metric units
    - Many more small improvements and bugfixes.

GpsMid 0.6
    *** Usability ***
       - Faster access to the map: There's no extra menu before the map screen anymore.
       - Icon menus are available as an alternative user interface (activateable in Setup / GUI Options).
         Multiple sized icon sets are included, choose with "useIcons = small|true|big|false" in the .properties file
         if and which icon set is included. Default is "useIcons = small|true", which includes a medium sized icon set.
       - Use numeric keys to directly access icons in icon menu and use long presses of numeric keys
         to directly access the tabs of the icon menu - this can be activated in Setup/GUI (thx Petr Dlouh�). 
       - Specify in Setup/Display Options to keep backlight on only while GPS is started.
       - Many more midlet colors are specifiable in the style-file now (including colors for night mode).
       - Display speed and distances in miles if configured in Setup.
       - Many mobile devices only allow to install rather small jar files (e.g. only 1 MB or 3 MB): 
         - A new workaround for this install a GpsMid with a small file size and
           to specify in it in Setup/Map Source another (bigger) GpsMid.jar as external map source
           (some devices require to rename the suffix of the .jar to .zip first)
           Many thx for the "j2me zipfile reading patch (no permission nags anymore)" to trendypack
         - On some mobiles the access to the external jar/zip won't work.
           If this is the case you can alternatively specify a directory with the unzipped contents
           of another large GpsMid.jar as external map source.
       - Some improvements to the quality of the included voice samples
    *** Touch screen support ***
        - Touch the street name status bar to show the icon menu.
        - Recenter to GPS button.
        - (De)activate manual rotation mode by touching the point of compass (use zoom buttons to rotate in manual rotation mode).
        - Show Map Features by touching the scale bar.
        - In the Search screen touching below or above the search results makes a standard input field show up
          (for touch screen devices without QWERT keyboard or numeric keys).
        - Touch the clock on the map to toggle the backlight, with some Nokia mobiles like Nokia 5800 it is also possible to
		  use the zoom buttons during "Backlight ON" message to dim the backlight on touchscreen mobiles.        
        - Show destination and move center to GPS to the left (thx jkpj).
    *** GPS and other location producers ***
       - Add a possibility to manually enter a connection URL, e.g. "comm:COM0;baudrate=115200".
       - CellId provider for S60FP2 usable with the python helper app (providing CellId via a local socket). 
       - CellId can now be used to position oneself without the need to connect to the Internet.
    *** Map Screen ***
       - Improved painting of way segments to draw them connected (thx pos_ei_don_). 
       - Faster painting of oneway arrows (thx pos_ei_don_).
       - Special rendering of ways that are bridges or tunnels (thx pos_ei_don_).
       - In Setup / Display Options there's now a text field for specifying how many seconds after
       	 the last user interaction the map will be automatically recentered to the GPS position
       - Better handling of appearing and disappearing text items (title bar, route instructions, etc.) on the map screen.
       - Optionally show speed when driving.
       - Optionally show altitude from GPS.
       - When there is no route calculated but a destination is set, show air distance
         instead of remaining route distance in the map screen.
       - New map feature "Auto zoom": This will automatically zoom the map in and out according to the driving speed
         (after zooming in or out manually in auto zoom mode, GPS recentering will also activate the auto zoom again).
       - Turn restrictions included in the midlet can be displayed in the map with Setup/Debug Options.
       - Max distance for displaying way name while scrolling is now calculated differently.
         A minimum of 10 meters is used for high zoom levels.
    *** Recordings, Tracks and Waypoints ***
       - Allow to save more than 255 waypoints again. (thx pos_ei_don)
       - Ask for track name at start/end of track recording - configurable in Setup / Recording Rules (thx jkpj).
       - Numbers of tracks and waypoints displayed in the title of the respective lists (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Current date added to name of waypoints file (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Better feedback (progress popups) during GPX imports and exports.
       - Better error message when GPX export fails, fixed typos (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Fix for the bug that waypoints were sometimes no longer drawn (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Using a different icon for waypoints than for the points of a track (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Fix for bug 2737256: Cursor position moved before "Set as target" (thx Petr Dlouh�).
       - Auto save the gpx track every 256 points, not only at the end of the recording.
       - Option to save a waypoint as favorite (will be shown in Search screen if no or only the first key is pressed).
       - Faster export of tracks and waypoints (on some Nokia devices).
       - Replay recorded track (experimental).
       - Timestamps in GPX exports when using internal GPS (JSR-179) were in local time, not UTC.
       - Time and elevation jumps in GPX (bug 2928508) when using internal GPS (JSR-179) fixed.
         With JSR-179, the WGS84 geoid elevation is now always used which is different
         from external GPS which uses mean sea level elevation.
    *** Map Elements ***
       - Many POI types added to the default style.
       - Different icons for churches, mosques, synagogues and unspecified religions.
       - Trunk and primary roads now have a colour of their own.
       - Improved visibility of railways based on GeoCache style - thx GoemonGps/billi25.
       - Add place=island as a workaround for land underwater - thx pos_ei_don_.
       - http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti:
          - new damages section in style-file to give certain ways / areas a red border
          - damage POIs for collapsed buildings and other earthquake damages
    *** Routing ***
       - Foot routing (if bundled into the midlet, see below).
       - Multiple Route Modes can be bundled into a single midlet with a setting in the .properties file,
         e.g. useRouting = motorcar, bicycle, foot
       - GpsMid asks which route mode to use on start of routing.
       - If you select "Optimize for routing" in GUI Options, "Route" will be the default action in the Search screen.
       - "Target" has been renamed to "Destination" throughout GpsMid.
       - Show remaining route distance to distance in map screen.
       - Optionally show remaining route duration / ETA in map screen
         (based on ways' typical/max speeds/number of traffic lights).
       - Check for turn restrictions for motorcar during route calculation 
       	 (can be turned off as it needs more memory and is slower).
       - Speed up of long distance route calculations for motorcars
         by using only the main street net (motorway, trunk, primary, seconday, tertiary)
         in the middle of the route.
         (Specify distance from start and destination where main street net calculation starts in Routing Options.)
       - Route calculation tries to find a motorway at the start of calculation (Option: Look for motorways).
       - Examine motorways further during route calculation, so it is not left too early when the motorway makes a curve
         but is in the long term the better route (Option: Boost motorways).
       - Examine trunks and primaries further to find the best way around cities instead of routing through
         (Option: Boost trunks & primaries).
       - Route Line is now determined in a separate thread in the background,
         therefore instructions can be given already before the route line is known completely.
       - Faster detection of the route line ways during rendering (speeds up map rendering, especially on long routes).
       - U-turn instruction added.
       - Cross area routing (e.g. for foot routing through pedestrian zones).
       - Permissive Route Access Restrictions are now possible
         (e.g. bicycle routing for an abandoned aeroway=runway if bicycle=true is set).
       - Much faster route calculation for bicycles (thx to apmonkey for the hint).
       - Only one "in xxx meters" voice instruction is given for each arrow.
       - http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti:
         routing repects impassable=yes and bridge=collapsed as non-routable
    *** OSM editing and other features only available with Internet connection ***
       - Support for GeoHack in "Online Info" (thx jkpj).
    *** Style-file and external media handling ***
       - High-style-file.xml has been renamed to style-file.xml and is used as 
         default style-file that is completely integrated into Osm2GpsMid.
         The high-style.zip is discontinued.
         By using an Unzip utility you can extract the style-file.xml from Osm2GpsMid and
         put it into the file system and customize it as before.
       - The former style-file.xml has been renamed to mini-style-file.xml and can be
         alternatively specified in the .properties file as "style-file = mini-style-file.xml".
       - External media in style-file will be searched relative to the style-file location.
         Therefore when you specify "style-file = myStyle/style-file.xml" in your .properties file
         Osm2GpsMid will look for external media files to include in myStyle/png and myStyle/sound directories.
    *** Midlet creation with Osm2GpsMid ***
       - Improved output, e.g. OSM links to errors to fix and duration for some creation steps.
       - New option maxTileWays0, maxTileWays1, maxTileWays2 and maxTileWays3 in .properties files
         for specifying the maximum number of ways bundled into tiles of tile zoom level 0 to 3:         
         With Osm2GpsMid 0.5.0, a maximum of 255 ways was included into each tile of a tile zoom level.
         This causes each Midlet to contain very many small files. By increasing the maximum ways  
         you can reduce the number of files in the Midlet, maybe making it possible to have larger maps
         on the mobile. However, having more ways in the tiles might require a device with
         more performance or memory to run GpsMid. Therefore the default maximum ways per tile is still 255. 
       - New option maxDictDepth in .properties files for specifying the dictionary depth for tiles.
         With Osm2GpsMid 0.5.0 this was hardcoded to 5. Increasing the value to e.g. 10 will 
         decrease the number of dictionary files in the midlet but require more memory in the mobile.
       - New option useSounds to specify which sound formats to include into the midlet,
         e.g. "sounds = wav, amr" will include wav and amr sound files. GpsMid will use the first successful
         playable sound format.

       - Highlighting the route solution path (the route solution is drawn on top if the map is synched with
         the GPS receiver but when panning manually it will respect the layer information),
         the minimum width of the route solution path can be specified in Setup/Routing Options 
       - Improved off-route detection
       - Routing instructions for entering and exiting motorways, for roundabouts, tunnels,
         for bearing if two alternative ways lead straight on and for following the street until further notice,
         when there's no instruction for at least 1200 meters
       - Browse the route instructions with up/down keys (can be deactivated in Setup)
       - Skip half turn instructions if the street name stays the same and straight-ons

         then Start Gps. When there's a new position from the GPS the route recalculation will
         be automatically performed
       - Some wrong direction arrows are fixed
       - See also next section for creating midlets with bicycle routing
       *** Midlet creation with Osm2GpsMid ***
       - Osm2GpsMid is now compiled to be compatible with Java 1.5 Runtime (for example on older Mac OSX)
       - RouteAccessRestrictions are now specified in the style-file instead of hardcoded into Osm2GpsMid
         and can be specified for separate vehicles
       - Each way can contain multiple routing entries (e.g. one for motorcar and one for bicycle)
       - Only the routing entries and RouteAccessRestrictions for the useRouting-parameter in the properties files
         are packed by Osm2GpsMid into the midlet, specify either "useRouting=motorcar" or "useRouting=bicycle"
         in you properties file
       - The Osm2GpsMid Wizard writes out the selected regions and chosen parameters
         on exit to a file called "last.properties" in the current directory even when canceled.
         This is a new way to easily get the necessary region parameters.
       - Use HTTP compression for downloading map data if the server supports it
       *** Others ***

         in the map regardless of zoom level for an overview.
         This can be useful to get a quick overview of a certain POI/Area/Way type in the area, i.e. hotels or railways.
         You can optionally choose to show POI/Area/Way types that are
         not selected in the Overview list normal or filter them out from display.
